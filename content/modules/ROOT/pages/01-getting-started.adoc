== OpenShift Cluster Login

The first thing to do is log in to your OpenShift cluster with the following
information:

*OpenShift Console*
link:{console_url}[{console_url},window='_blank']

*Username*

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{user}
----

*Password*

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{password}
----

Clicking the link above for the OpenShift Console will take you to the OpenShift
login screen where you can login using the provided username and password.

[#open-web-terminal]
== Workshop Web Terminal

On the right side of your screen is a web terminal which includes many of the
necessary command-line tools you need to interact with. By default the terminal
is logged in with a service account with limited permissions, execute the following
command to login as {user}.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{login_command}
----

When you login you will see a prompt about using an insecure connection as the Kubernetes API
in this workshop is using a default certificate, type `y` to accept and the login will continue.

*Once completed you should see the following in the terminal:*

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
[lab-user: ~]$ {login_command}
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

WARNING: Using insecure TLS client config. Setting this option is not supported!

Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * {user}-argocd
    {user}-bgd
    {user}-bgdh
    {user}-bgdk
    {user}-todo

Using project "user1-argocd".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
