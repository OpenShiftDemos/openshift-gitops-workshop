You will frequently see references to `userX` in the documentation for this
workshop. `X` will correspond to the specific user number that matches your
account. For example, if you were assigned `user6`, then `X` would be `6` for
you.

[#cluster-login]
== OpenShift cluster login

The first thing to do is log in to your OpenShift cluster. In the previous
screen that handed you your workshop credentials should be a link to the
OpenShift console, as well as a username and password. Click that link, which
will take you to the OpenShift login screen:

Once logged in, make sure that you choose the _Developer_ perspective using the
switcher in the upper-left:

[#open-web-terminal]
== OpenShift Web Terminal

OpenShift conveniently provides a web-based terminal that includes many of the 
necessary command-line tools you need to interact with. You can open the web
terminal by clicking its launcher button on the upper right menu, near your 
username:

You will be asked to choose which project in which to initialize your terminal. 
This workshop has created several Kubernetes namespaces (OpenShift projects) for
you. It doesn't _really_ matter which one you choose, but we recommend that you
initialize your terminal in the project that houses Argo CD:
`user%USER_NUM%-argocd`. 

Once the terminal is launched, you'll see it at the bottom of your screen:

You probably want to pop-out the terminal into a new browser window/tab so that
you can see the OpenShift console with your full screen. There's a pop-out
button on the right side:
