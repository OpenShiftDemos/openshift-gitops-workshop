link:https://kustomize.io/[Kustomize] traverses a Kubernetes manifest to add,
remove or update configuration options without forking. It is available both as
a standalone binary and as a native feature of `kubectl` (and by extension
`oc`).

The principals of `kustomize` are:

* Purely declarative approach to configuration customization
* Manage an arbitrary number of distinctly customized Kubernetes configurations
* Every artifact that kustomize uses is plain YAML and can be validated and
  processed as such
* As a "templateless" templating system; it encourages using YAML without
  forking the repo it.

== Exploring the Kustomize CLI

The `kustomize` CLI should have been installed as part of the lab
setup. Verify that it has been installed.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize version --short
----


This should display the version, it should look something like this.

----


Kustomize, at its core, is meant to build on top of native Kubernetes manifests
based on YAML while leaving the original YAML in tact. It achieves this in a
"template-less" templating format. This is done by providing a
`kustomization.yaml` file.

We will be focusing on two Kustomize sub-commands: the `build` command and the
`edit` command.

The `build` command takes the YAML source (via a path or URL) and creates a new
YAML that can be piped into `oc create`. We will work with an example in the
`documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build` directory within the
repository you cloned.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd ~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build
----

Here you should see two files, a `kustomization.yaml` file and a `welcome.yaml`
file, let's have a look at them.

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build/welcome.yaml[welcome.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$kustomize-build/welcome.yaml[]
----

This file shows nothing special. Just a standard Kubernetes manifest.

What if, for example, we wanted to add a `label` to this manifest without
editing it? This is where the `kustomization.yaml` file comes in.

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/kustomize-build/kustomization.yaml[kustomization.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$kustomize-build/kustomization.yaml[]
----

As you can see in the output there isn't much. The two sections for this
example are the `resources` and the `patchesJson6902` sections.

`resources` is an array of individual files, directories, and/or URLs where
other manifests are stored. In this example we are just loading in one file. The
(https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/patchesjson6902/[`patchesJson6902`
is a patching RFC] that `kustomize` supports. As you can see, in the
`patchesJson6902` file, I am adding a label to this manifest.

[NOTE]
====
You can read about what options are available for patching in the
https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/[official
documentation site]
====

Build this manifest by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize build
----

You can see that the new label got added to the manifest!

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: welcome-php
    testkey: testvalue
  name: welcome-php
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: welcome-php
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: welcome-php
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php:ffcd15
        name: welcome-php
        resources: {}
----

You can use the `kustomize edit` command instead of writing YAML. For
example, you can change the image tag this `Deployment` uses from `latest`
to `ffcd15` by running the following:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize edit set image quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php:ffcd15
----

This will update the `kustomization.yaml` file with a `images` section.
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat kustomization.yaml
----

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- ./welcome.yaml
patchesJson6902:
- patch: |-
    - op: add
      path: /metadata/labels/testkey
      value: testvalue
  target:
    group: apps
    kind: Deployment
    name: welcome-php
    version: v1
images:
- name: quay.io/redhatworkshops/welcome-php
  newTag: ffcd15
----

Now when you run:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
 kustomize build .
----

You should see not only the new label but also the new `ffcd15` image tag.

[NOTE]
====
You may have to close the `kustomization.yaml` tab and re-open it to
see the changes.
====

You can see how you can take already existing YAML and modify it for
your specific environment without the need to copy or edit the original.

Kustomize can also be used to write a new YAML file and pipe into
the `kubectl` (or `oc`) command. Example:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
----

[#exploring_kustomize_with_kubectl]
=== Exploring Kustomize with Kubectl

Since Kubernetes 1.14, The `kubectl` command (and by extension the
`oc` cli) has support for Kustomize built in.

You can see this by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc kustomize --help
----

This runs the `kustomize build` command. You can see this by running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc kustomize
----

Although you can use this to pipe it into the apply command, you
don't have to. The `kubectl apply` command has the `-k` option that
will run the build before it applies the manifest.

[NOTE]
====
`kubectl` and `oc kustomize` implement a subset of the `kustomize`
featureset. For example, the `edit` command is not implemented.
====

Now you will apply your `kustomize`-d manifest into one of your projects:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc apply -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk -k ./
----

[NOTE]
====
You can pass not only directories, but URLs as well.
The only requirement is that you have a `kustomization.yaml` file in the path.
====

This should create the deployment and you should see the pods running in the namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get pods -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk
----

You can see the deployment was created with the additional labels:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get deployment welcome-php -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk | jq -r
----

Also, the image was updated based on the customization that was made:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get deploy welcome-php -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[].image}{"\n"}'
----

As you can see `kustomize` can be a powerful tool.

You can delete the applied resources with `oc delete` and kustomize, too:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc delete -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk -k ./
----

[#deploying_kustomized_application]
== Deploying Kustomized Application

In previous chapter, you learned that in a GitOps workflow; the
entire application stack (including infrastructure) is reflected
in a git repo. The challenge is how to do this without duplicating
YAML.

So now that you've explored `kustomize`, let's see how it fits into Argo
CD and how it can be used in a GitOps workflow.

Before proceeding, move back into the examples home directory:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd ~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples
----

[#kustomized_application]
=== Kustomized Application

Argo CD has native support for Kustomize. You can use this to avoid
duplicating YAML for each deployment. This is especially good to
use if you have different environments or clusters you're deploying
to.

Take a look at this `Application` definition:

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgdk-app.yaml[bgdk-app.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bgdk-app.yaml[]
----

As you will see below, this `Application` definition refers to the same **base** resources you used in
the previous lab scenario. It references a directory path (`documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgdk`)
which contains a new `kustomization.yaml` file specific to this application. This concept is called an **overlay**:
where you have a **base** set of manifests and you **overlay** your customizations.

Click link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#bases-and-overlays[here,window='_blank'] to learn more about Kustomize bases and overlays, 

Now take a look at this `Kustomization` defintion:

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgdk/kustomization.yaml[kustomization.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$bgdk/kustomization.yaml[]
----

This `kustomization.yaml` takes the base application located at `documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-base`
and patches the `Deployment` manifest so that you get yellow dots instead of blue ones.

Now deploy this application:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
sed 's/$USERNUM/%USERNUM%/' ~/openshift-gitops-workshop/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgdk-app.yaml | oc apply -n user%USERNUM%-argocd -f -
----

[#argocd_web_console]
=== The Argo CD Web Console

Switch back to the Argo CD Web UI, you may be
presented with the Argo CD login screen again.

image::argo-cd-login.png[ArgoCD Login]

You can login using your the same credential you used for OpenShift which
were provided by the workshop administrator.

This should now show you two apps on the Argo CD UI.

image::two-apps.png[Two Apps]

Open the Route for this application. It's in the `user%USERNUM%-bgdk` Project.
Remember you can get this from the topology view, or from the CLI:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route -n user%USERNUM%-bgdk bgd -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

You should see yellow balls flying around. This is the same application you used
previously, and so you know that by changing the environment variable on the
deployment you can change the ball color.

Argo CD deployed the application with your `kustomize`-ations! To review what we
just did:

* Deployed an Application called `bgd` with a blue square.
* Deployed another Application based on `bgd` called `bgdk`
* The Application `bgdk` was deployed in its own namespace, with deployment
  customizations.
* ALL without having to duplicate YAML!
